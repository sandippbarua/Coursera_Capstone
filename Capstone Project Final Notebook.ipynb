Our company, XYZ Data Analytics, has been hired\n    to identify 5 locations within the Boston city limits where the company can open its pizza stores.\n    \n    In order to maximize the probability that these 5 locations will be the best possible locations, in terms of profitablity, for the new stores,\n    Bob's Pizza has provided a set of guidelines that have proven successfull in other cities where they have established stores.\n    These guidelines are:\n        - Target neighborhoods which have existing fast food stores, including coffee shops, but are underserved by pizza shops.\n        - Do not target neighborhoods that have a high presence of pizza stores already.\n        - Target neighborhoods that have a higher concentration of hotels.\n        \n    Bob's Pizza expects a final proposal to include the data that was used to reach the final conclusion.",

The guidelines from Bob's Pizza will be taken into consideration to define a new set of rules that can be\n    applied to the FourSquare data to determine the 5 best pizza store locations.\n    \n    The various Boston neighborhoods will be determined from the following data set,\n    http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3525b0ee6e6b427f9aab5d0a1d0a1a28_0.csv\n        \n    The python 'geocoder' package will be used to determine the co-ordinates for each Boston neighborhood.\n    \n    These neighborhood coordinates will be fed to the FourSquare API to obtain the necessary neigborhood business data.\n    ",
